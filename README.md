## Contributing Guide

All work on SimpleLogin Chrome/Firefox extension happens directly on GitHub.

To run the extension locally, please follow these steps:

- install all dependencies with `npm install`.
- run `npm start` to generate the `/dist` folder that can be installed into Chrome.

On Firefox, it can be done via `web-ext` tool from within the `/dist` folder: 

```bash 
( cd dist/ ; web-ext run )
```

The code is formatted using `prettier`, make sure to run it before creating the commit, otherwise the GitHub lint workflow will mark the check as not passing:

```bash
npm run prettier:write
```

## How to generate a release

1. Increment the version in `package.json`.
2. Update CHANGELOG with the changes.
3. Create a tag and push it to the repository. The tag name must match the version set in `package.json`.
4. Wait until the CI process generates the extension ZIP and uploads it to GitHub. You will be able to find the generated zip as an artifact attached to the [GitHub release](https://github.com/simple-login/browser-extension/releases).
5. Upload the extension to the Chrome, Firefox, and Edge stores.


## How to build the extension locally

In order to build the extension yourself, please follow these steps:

- Make sure you have the dependencies installed and up-to-date with `npm install`.
- Run the build process with `npm run build`.
- Create the zip package with `npm run build-zip`. You will find the extension in the `dist-zip/` directory.
- If you want to use it on Firefox you will need to enter the `dist/` directory and run `web-ext build`. You will find the extension in the `dist/web-ext-artifacts/` directory.  

- (Optional, only useful for beta build) Build beta version: change `betaRev` in `package.json`, then generate zip file using

```bash
npm run build:beta && npm run build-zip
```
